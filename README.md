# Air-Canvas

Air Canvas can be used to write on the screen for demonstration purpose or teaching.

It uses webcamera for capturing a particular colour in the camera window and traces a line on the camera windows.

This window contains 4 different colours (red, green, blue and yellow) and an option to clear everything (lines) from the screen.

This project is made by using Python as a programming language.

Libraries used to create this project are OpenCV and Numpy.
